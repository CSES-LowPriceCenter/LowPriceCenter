   * refers to "TaskForm". The second parameter is a function that contains the
   * code for the test.
   *
   * This first test simply renders the component, then checks that the "New
   * task" title is present. These kinds of tests are easy to write but do not
   * verify any actual behavior/logic, so be sure to write additional tests like
   * the third and fourth ones in this file.
   *
   * `it` is actually an alias for the `test` function. We use `it` so it reads
   * like a sentence.
