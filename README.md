# Low-Price Center

An e-commerce platform for UCSD students to exchange and sell goods.

## Description

Low-Price Center is designed to help UCSD students exchange and sell goods in a streamlined, centralized way. Instead of posting to Reddit or other similar websites, they'll have a more secure and organized place to buy and sell goods with each other on campus. It will also be a resource for student organizations to sell merchandise without having to build their own portals.

This project is a part of CSES Open-Source, and will transition to a full open-source project once there is an MVP. The current goal is to get a basic version of the site up and running so that it'll become easier to contribute to.
